# world-quantum-day-2024

World Quantum Day (WQD) takes place every April 14 to raise public awareness and understanding of quantum science and technology.

## Privacy and Security

Current encryption methods often use calculations that are easy to perform but very hard to reverse - such as finding the prime factors of large numbers. It is said that Quantum Computing won't break passwords - it'll break encryption by making these "hard to reverse'' tasks easy. How might this affect us in terms of passwords, privacy, and security? Are new cryptographic techniques being developed in anticipation of quantum computing?

## Qubit Problems

Traditional computing represents information as a bit - either 0 or 1. Quantum computing uses a qubit - it's like each one holds a vector that points to a place on a sphere of radius one. Every place on the surface of the sphere is a possible value, so each qubit can hold many possible "superpositions" of 0 and 1 - in addition to the traditional 0 (the north pole) and 1 (the south pole). What kind of problems will this be useful for? 

## Entanglement

Is it true that qubits can be entangled so the state of one qubit affects the state of another qubit immediately - even over vast distances? How is that property useful for solving problems? 

## Machine Learning / AI

As data analysts, we use a variety of methods to get our machines to make sense of massive amounts of data. How will quantum computing enhance machine learning (ML)? Are there areas of ML - and artificial intelligence - that might especially benefit from quantum computing?

## Work / Home Devices

Will there be a home Quantum Personal Computer?  What's a likely timeline for quantum computing becoming an everyday tool?

## Moore's Law

Since 1965, Moore's Law suggests processing power doubles approximately every 18-24 months. Do you think this trend will hold - or accelerate - or will we see a "quantum leap" in general processing power?

## Complex Problems

Will quantum computing be able to help solve complex problems such as climate change and human health?

## Students & Professionals

What should students or professionals interested in the new possibilities be learning? What skills and knowledge will be most valuable? (For those who want to use the new technologies - not build them.)
